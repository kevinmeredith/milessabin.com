title:      macro-compat-1.1.0 (and 1.0.7) released, 1.0.6 deprecated

Whoops! Binary compatibility was broken in 1.0.3 and again in 1.0.6. <span class="break"></span> In version 1.0.7
binary compatability with 1.0.3-5 has been restored and 1.0.6 is now deprecated. The binary compatibility breaking
changes have been moved to 1.1.0 and hopefully the addition of [MiMa][mima] to the build will make a recurrence of
this sort of breakage much less likely in future.

Release notes follow ...

[macro-compat]: https://github.com/milessabin/macro-compat
[mima]: https://github.com/typesafehub/migration-manager

These release notes provide a summary of changes since macro-compat 1.0.6.

+ Restored binary compatibility with versions 1.0.3-5.

+ Added [MiMa][mima] to the build.

These release notes provide a summary of changes since macro-compat 1.0.7.

+ Binary compatibility breaking changes from 1.0.6 have been reinstated.

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed ideas, enthusiasm and encouragement.
